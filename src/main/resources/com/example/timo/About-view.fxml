The pieces were so large that a single pawn was the size of a &#10;small house, and the towering knights were as tall as mountains. The giants &#10;played with such force that the ground shook with every move, and the sound &#10;of clashing chess pieces echoed throughout the land. The games were legendary, &#10;and spectators would gather from far and wide to witness the spectacle. The &#10;giants played with skill and strategy, each move deliberate and calculated, &#10;until one of them emerged victorious. To the giants, chess was not just a&#10;game, but a test of strength, intelligence, and power.&#10;&#10;The day for the awaited final match arrived. Even the clouds gathered to watch &#10;the clash of the titans, causing a dark sky but with enough light&#10;A pawn advanced, a bishop moved, a knight leapt forth, a rook behooved, &#10;The queen stood tall, the king in wait, The board was already set for a royal debate. &#10;Black and white, the armies stood, Each piece poised for the greater good,&#10;Strategies formed, tactics plotted, The battle for supremacy had started.&#10;&#10;A pawn to f4, a knight to g3, A bishop to c4, a rook to e3,&#10;The queen to d2, the king to safety, And a trap was set for the opponent's fallacy.&#10;A move was made, a trap sprung, The opponent's plan was unravelled and undone,&#10;A checkmate was delivered, victory was claimed, The opponent was left confused and ashamed.&#10;Chess, a game of skill and wit, Teasing the opponent bit by bit,&#10;With each move, the tension grows, Until the final blow, the game's grandiose.&#10;&#10;This game is made for you by  The Giants&#10;Wasswa Lutufi Sebbanja 200041156&#10;Pendah Coulibaly 200041162&#10;Ibrahim Ahmed Ibrahim 200041164" textAlignment="CENTER">
